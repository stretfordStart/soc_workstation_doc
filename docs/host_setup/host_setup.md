# Host Setup

The selection of Arch Linux as the host system for the SOC Workstation is based on its versatility and lightweight design. Arch Linux's adaptability allows for the creation of a highly customized system, tailored to meet the specific requirements of the workstation.

The installation process kicks off with the utilization of archinstall, simplifying the setup with a user-friendly approach. This is complemented by the integration of custom configuration files that finely tune the system settings. These configurations cover various aspects, including security, networking, and resource allocation.

To ensure the host system is fully equipped for its role in malware analysis, a post-installation script is executed. This script automates additional adjustments and configurations, further enhancing the system's readiness.
