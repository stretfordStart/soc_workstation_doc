# Host Setup

The choice of Arch Linux as the host system for the SOC Workstation is grounded in its versatility and lightweight design. Arch Linux's adaptability allows for a highly customized system, perfectly suited to the specialized needs of the workstation.

The installation process begins with the utilization of archinstall, streamlining the setup with a user-friendly approach. This is complemented by the integration of custom configuration files, which fine-tune the system settings. These configurations encompass various aspects, such as security, networking, and resource allocation.

To ensure the host system is fully equipped for its role in malware analysis, a post-installation script is executed. This script automates further adjustments and configurations, enhancing the system's readiness.
